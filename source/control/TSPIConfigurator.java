//TODO this class will present input options for everything about generating the TSPI for the packet. The information
// will be used to create some kind of generator that will be used inside a SensorGenerator
// - some packets may only want position, some may want position/velocity, some position/velocity/acceleration
// - we may want to allow selection of a rawch file for population of TSPI
